# HotelBooking
Internship project

This is a web application for booking a room in hotels. 

This project was made as an internship graduation task in cooperation with @ascererak, @dpoltavska, @AlekseyBozhko and with wise mentoring from @telamar.
We have done all of the project lifecycle activities - starting from the design and user stories and ending with the demo of the release version of the product.
We have been working by scrum rules - with stories, tasks, users stories and sprints.

From the technical side, we used:
- ASP.NET Core for the back-end server
- React.js for the front-end
- N-tier architecture
- Embedded to the Virtual Sturio MS SQL server as a database
- Entity Framework for communication with the database
- Indentity framework for the user authentification
- NUnit as a test framework
- Bootstrap for the design purposes

Also we used:
- Azure DevOps as a version control system, task board, user stories collector and deployment pipeline

It was kind of fun, special thanks to all of my teammates for this wonderful project
